# Frogger
This is a CSCI201 project for learning about P5.js
In this sketch, you play as a frog trying to get to the pond at the top of the screen. While doing this, you must avoid cars.
Every five times you reach the end the level changes. As the levels increase, so too do the roadways, cars, points for going up, and the speed of the cars.
Every 4000 points net an extra life. The game ends when your lives reach zero.
